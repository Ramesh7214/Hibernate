load() dont hit database when it is called. it create on dummy proxy object with provided identifier. remaining properties are empty.
when we call any property with proxy (ex : emp.getXX()) then it hits the database. if record found return the object, else return exception

get() directly hit the database and fetch the records, if record not found then return null
