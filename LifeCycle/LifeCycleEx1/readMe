Transient state : when we created new object. 
Persistent state : when we saved it to database. till session cache cleared or session closed object will be in Persistent state . in this state
one row should created in DB.
Detached state : Session not associated with any Session. that mean, session cache cleared or session closed

if we want Detached to Transient state , need to delete row from the database
