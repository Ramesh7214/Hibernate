when we use premitive it saving 0 for int. 
that mean default values are inserting
to prevent it we have to use Warapers 

in the example check the sal, it inserting 0. becuase in the pojo sal is int

change int to Integer and insert new record and check the record. now it is empty

in price case, it is big mistake
