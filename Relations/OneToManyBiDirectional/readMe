check the logic, we have saved only 3rd employee record, but it saved all the three employee records alogn with parent(Department) object.

How ????????

its all done by attribute inverse="true"

inverse="true" indicates the hibernate that, object can save in any direction.

before saving the employee 3, we have added all the three employee objects to Department.

when we saved the thired employee, it tries to save parent object, as already all the childs mapped to parent, it goign to save all the 
childs also.

So, again no need to save other childs (even saving is wrong)

it saves the internal operations
